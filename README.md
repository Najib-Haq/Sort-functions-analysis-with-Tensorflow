<h1>GOAL</h1>
To analyze the time complexity of some sorting functions with real time data and by using tensorflow, predict
the time complexity of these functions in other scenarios.

<h1>Methodology</h1>
The sorting functions considered here are : Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort and Heap sort.
These functions are coded in [sorting_algos] (sorting_algos.py)
